### Running FreshRSS on Fly.io

FreshRSS is a free, self-hostable RSS feeds aggregator. [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) is super amazing platform that runs application servers close to end users. 

Fly.io can take Docker images (or Dockerfiles, or buildpacks) and boot them into [Firecracker](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/firecracker-lightweight-virtualization-for-serverless-computing/) powered microVMs. When you deploy with Fly.io, you get an Anycast IP, along with TLS offloading by them.

These are the steps if you wish to run FreshRSS on your fly.io account

* Sign up for Fly.io
* Install [flyctl](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/)
* Sign into your Fly.io account by typing `flyctl auth login`
* Create a `fly.toml` file similar to the one in [the repo](/fly.toml). Make sure to update the appname to something else.
* Review the environment variables listed in the `[env]` section, and update if required. You can check [FreshRSS' docs](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/blob/edge/Docker/freshrss/example.env) on the environment variables that can be updated 
* Create a volume for persisting data using the command `fly volumes create freshrss_data --size 1`
    * In this command, we create a volume of size 1GB. This can be increased later, so I selected the lowest possible number, as flyctl expects size in GB and doesn't accept fractional numbers.
* Save the `fly.toml` and from the same directory where `fly.toml` is present, launch the application using `fly launch`. flyctl will pull the Docker image and launch the VM. The output should be similar to below: 

```bash

fly launch
